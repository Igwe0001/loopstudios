## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to practice using display grid. It was an exciting challenge because I now understand how to use display grid, figure amd the picture elements. They are very essential in this project for a proper semantic HTML.

See below:

```html
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="./images/desktop/image-deep-earth.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">
            <img src="./images/mobile/image-deep-earth.jpg" alt="deep earth">
          </picture>
          <figcaption>Deep earth</figcaption>
        </figure>
```


### Continued development

I would like to continue working on much harder projects, I belive I can improve my skills that way.
